# A note from Liza:

This is an **intro React lesson** starting from zero. It uses **ES6** syntax and **create-react-app**, an easy command that creates a react app for you (exactly like the `rails new` command or `npm init`).


This lesson contains 10 tiny apps that start with the most basic React component.

To get started, simply `npm start` (or `npm install` if you've just pulled this from my repo).


**Directions:**
- Open `src/index.js`
- Uncomment out the apps one at a time
